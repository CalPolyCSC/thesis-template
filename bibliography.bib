	abstract = {A calculative method is presented for turbulent boundary-layer, inviscid flow interactions for axisymmetric configurations of the type used for isolated nozzle afterbody models. The method is applicable to flows with subsonic freestreams, including slightly supercritical flows, and to bodies with high-pressure exhaust plumes or solid plume simulators. Integral boundary-layer and plume entrainment methods are coupled iteratively with a finite-difference inviscid flow method through a boundary-layer plume displacement thickness. Results are presented which indicate that the procedure provides an accurate engineering prediction method for boattail flowfield with moderately underexpanded exhaust flows and for bodies with solid plume simulators.},
