Powering spacecraft with electric propulsion is on the rise, especially in the cubesat category. It is important to have good analysis and modeling tools to understand the minute details of the electric propulsion engines, particularly the plasma plume. The Navier-Stokes equations used in classic computational fluid dynamics do not apply to the non-continuum plasma and therefore another method must be used to model the flow. A good solution is to use the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method which uses a combination of particle by particle modeling and statistical methods for modeling the simulated molecules. 

A DSMC simulation known as SINATRA has been developed with the goal to model electric propulsion plumes. SINATRA uses a octree mesh, is written in C++, and is designed to be expanded by further research. SINATRA has been initially validated through several tests and comparisons to theoretical data and other DSMC models. Multiple molecular model schemes and collision schemes were also tested for validity, accuracy, and speed. This thesis examines expanding the functionality of SINATRA to simulate charged particles. It includes additional features to simplify further research including  a comprehensive User Manual, version control, simple text file inputs, GUI control, and simple parallelism of the simulation. It will be validated through multiple test cases of charged particles and plumes to demonstrate the accuracy and abilities of the model.
