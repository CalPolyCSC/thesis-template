\begin{acknowledgments}

    This page is optional, but if you have received funding for your research or assistance or guidance that you feel should be noted, it belongs on this page. If you are not including acknowledgments, remove the contents of the acknowledgments file. If you are acknowledging only one person, change the title to ACKNOWLEDGMENT by removing commented line in acknowledgments file.

    If you would like to dedicate your thesis to someone/something, then this is where that would go as well. It cannot go in a separate dedication page.  % per Grad. Ed. 6/2025

    Thanks to:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Andrew Guenther, for uploading the original template, and
        \item Someone Else, so that I do not have to rename this page.
    \end{itemize}
