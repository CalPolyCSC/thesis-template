    %% Difference between Biblography and References
    % A bibliography is a collection of resources that you found of value
    % related to your thesis. It includes all items that you cited in your
    % thesis as well as any other valuable references.
    %
    % On the other hand, a references section is just the items that you cited
    % in your thesis.
    %
    % For a references section use the following lines:


    % For a bibliography, put all references you want in your bibliography
    % into your bib-file, then use the following lines:
    \nocite{*}
    \printbibliography[
        heading=bibintoc,
        title={\MakeUppercase{Bibliography}}
    ]

    %% Input the appendices (if any) as configured from the file
    % If not needed, then this line can be removed.
