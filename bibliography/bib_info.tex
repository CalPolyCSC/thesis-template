%% Difference between Biblography and References
%
% A bibliography is a collection of resources that you found of value
% related to your thesis. It includes all items that you cited in your
% thesis as well as any other valuable references.
%
% On the other hand, a references section is just the items that you cited
% in your thesis.

% For a bibliography, put all references you want in your bibliography
% into your bib-file, then use the following line:
\nocite{*}

% For a references section use the following line:
%\renewcommand{\bibname}{References}
