This page is optional, but if you have received funding for your research or assistance or guidance that you feel should be noted, it belongs on this page. If you are not including acknowledgments, delete this page. If you are acknowledging only one person, change the title to ACKNOWLEDGMENT.

Thanks to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Andrew Guenther, for uploading this template, and
    \item Someone Else, so that I do not have to rename this page.
\end{itemize}
